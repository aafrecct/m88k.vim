m88k Syntax for Vim
-------------------
A simple syntax file for the Motorola 88k microchip assembly language.

At the "ETSIINF" this language is used to teach students a touch of assembly programming,
and as of right now I belive Notepad++'s "Assembly Language" option decently highlights the language.
Emacs might also have a syntax highlighter for it, IDK.
And there's [M-T3K/M88k](https://github.com/M-T3K/M88K) for Visual Studio Cde.
